# Arjun-Maths-Notes
Maths Notes created by me. These notes are generally neither complete nor comprehensive. Most of them are pretty much useless right now. I intend to update and improve them over time.
I plan to eventually make notes for every topic in these areas: Real Analysis, Abstract Algebra, Elementary Number Theory, Multivariable and Vector Calculus, and Linear Algebra.
