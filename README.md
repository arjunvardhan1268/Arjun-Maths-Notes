# Arjun-Maths-Notes
Maths Notes created by me for courses at SNU. These notes are generally neither complete nor comprehensive. Most of them are pretty much useless right now. I intend to update and improve them over time.
I plan to eventually make notes for every topic in these courses: Algebra I and II (MAT240 and MAT241), Real Analysis I and II (MAT220 and MAT221), Elementary Number Theory (MAT440). This will probably take a very long time. Hopefully I will make good progress in Summer 2022 since I'll have free time.
